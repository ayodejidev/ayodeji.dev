I had a fantastic experience at the just-concluded API Days Paris conference! The agenda was packed with innovative and insightful sessions, spanning various AI and API-themed tracks. With so many exciting talks happening simultaneously, choosing which ones to attend was no small feat 😄 Here are some of my key highlights from the event:

## **🎙️ Sessions that stood out for me**

* [Ikenna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ikenna/) shared valuable tips for tackling OpenAPI Drift, including short-term fixes and long-term strategies. This topic was particularly interesting, especially as recent API Context research (OpenAPI Specifications in the Real World, August 2024) revealed that 75% of tested APIs had nonconformant endpoints.
    
* In another insightful talk, [Beppe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beppecatanese/) from [**Adyen**](https://adyen.com) outlined the 7 Rules for Crafting Developer-Friendly API Libraries. The accompanying blog post is a must-read! [**Check it out**](https://beppecatanese.hashnode.dev/api-libraries-7-golden-rules)
    
* [Bruno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bpedro/) delivered an impactful session on how API Governance Drives Quality, highlighting the key elements that define API quality and the top goals of governance frameworks.

* **Mario** took us on a fascinating journey showcasing how **DHL** delivers Best-in-Class Logistic APIs, sharing their approach to managing APIs at “planet scale”.
    
* From the API Design track, [Mike](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mamund/) author of Design and Build Great APIs, shared practical and timely examples on designing APIs that are not only functional but also successful in the long term.

Overall, I gained so much knowledge from this conference, from learning about several OpenAPI and DocOps initiatives to gaining fresh insights into API Governance. Most importantly, it reinforced the importance of designing and delivering quality APIs with an API-first mindset.

One of the highlights of the event was meeting and exchanging ideas with amazing API experts and members of the API community.

I’m already looking forward to attending more API Days conferences in the future! If you’re passionate about APIs, I highly recommend attending one of these events. Check out API Days [**official website**](https://www.apidays.global/paris/) for more details.
